# react_test
Testing React


Use server, not file system to open index.html
npm install http-server -g
then go to directory with index.html and run
http-server



For chrome, install React Developer Tools
Open Debugger on Chrome and in the end you will see a tab called React
(After adding chrome app, close that tab and start a new tab to see chrome app changes)

Reference to this file is required to debug:
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.23/browser.min.js"></script>
	
  
  
Also, reference to JSX files should be made in this format:
<script type="text/babel" src="js/app.jsx"></script>
